# **FALCON: Flexible Aerial and Land reCONnaissance System**  

FALCON (**Flexible Aerial and Land reCONnaissance**) is a fully autonomous capable aerial-ground surveillance system designed for reconnaissance in environments with **limited aerial visibility** (e.g., dense forests, urban canyons). The system consists of a **hexacopter UAV** capable of **tethered deployment and retrieval** of an **autonomous GPS-guided ground rover**, allowing for **seamless integration of aerial and terrestrial intelligence gathering**.  

### **🛸 Key Features**  
- **Autonomous Hexacopter UAV** – Powered by **Pixhawk**, featuring **dual GPS and dual compass** for enhanced redundancy.  
- **Tethered Deployment & Retrieval** – Enables precise airdrop and recovery of the ground rover for extended mission flexibility.  
- **Fully Autonomous Ground Rover** – GPS-guided rover controlled by **ArduRover autopilot**, capable of navigating challenging terrain.  
- **High Payload Capacity** – Empty drone can carry up to **4kg** of payload, allowing for mission adaptability.  
- **Extended Mission Endurance** – Supports multiple battery configurations for **longer flight durations**.  
- **Surveillance & Reconnaissance** – Designed for intelligence gathering in environments where aerial drones face visibility limitations (e.g., dense foliage, urban environments).
- **Visuals:** **Real-time** video transmission with **1 tiltable top-mounted camera** and **1 gimbal-mounted, pan-tilt capable action camera**
